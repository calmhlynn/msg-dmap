# Tokio based mpsc Channels

This project is a work-in-progress aimed at implementing a concurrency model using Tokio's mpsc channels. The goal is to integrate with Redis, Kafka, and a database to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.

## Project Objectives

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Utilize Tokio's mpsc channels for non-blocking message passing.
- **Future Integrations**: Plan to support Redis, Kafka, and database operations for comprehensive data handling.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design to manage multiple concurrent tasks effectively.
